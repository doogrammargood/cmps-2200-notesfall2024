    "$\\Sigma$ = \\{\"a\", \"t\", \"g\", \"c\"\\}. We define $\\Sigma^\\star$ to be $\\Sigma \\cup \\{\\_\\}$, where $\\_$ is a blank symbol.\n",
    " Turing Machine consists of the following data:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A finite set, called <i>states</i>, denoted $S$.\n",
    "2. A set of states called the <i>accept states</i>, denoted $S_a\\subset S$.\n",
    "3. A special state called the <i>initial state</i>, denoted $s_0 \\in S$.\n",
    "4. A current state $c\\in S$, which can change.\n",
    "5. An infinite tape of <i>cells</i>. \n",
    "    - Each cell has a location. The locations correspond to integers.\n",
    "    - Each cell can contain a letter from the alphabet or be blank.\n",
    "6. A <i>head</i> which represents a location on the tape.\n",
    "7. A transition function $T:(\\Sigma^\\star \\times S)\\to (\\Sigma^\\star \\times S \\times\\{L,R,S\\}) \\cup \\{Halt\\}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "The machine operates as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "We assume that the tape initially contains the input to the machine. The machine starts at the initial state, $s_0$ and the head starts at the $0^{th}$ cell on the tape. At each step in the computation, the machine applies the transition function as follows. The input to the transition function is the letter that is written on the tape at the location of the head and the current state $c$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The outputs $(x,s,D)$ of the transition function indicate to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write $x$ onto the tape at the location of the head.\n",
    "2. Change the state to $c=s$.\n",
    "3. Move the head left if $D=L$, right if $D=R$ and leave the head if $D=S$.\n",

    "Usually, we only talk about accept/reject problems for simplicity. These are also called <i>descision problems</i>. But Turing Machines are not limited to descision problems. They can modify the contents of the tape. As a homework exercise, you will describe a Turing Machine that takes in a binary number and increments it by one. This demonstrates that they can perform complex calculations, like a Python program. \n",

    "Every algorithm that can be written in Python consists of finitely many lines. At any point in the algorithm, there is a single line that is active, and these correspond to the states of the Turing machine. The algorithm, expressed in Python, also stores the values of the variables, which are like the contents of the tape. Each line of python code passes to the next line, and possibly modifies some variables. The action of the current line of code is similar to the action of the transition function of the Turing Machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between Python code and the Turing Machine is that there is no Python analog of the Turing Machine's head. Python code is assumed to be able to read or modify the value of any variable in a single step (this is called <i>random access</i>), whereas the head of the Turing Machine needs to move to the cell that represents that variable. The Turing Machine may be slower, but this analogy should make it clear that every Python script has a corresponding Turing Machine.\n",

    "A modern computer is like $\\mathcal{U}$, and the program that it runs is like the machine $\\mathcal{M}$. The input to the machine is like $arg$.
