We argued that we could search the graph for alternating paths. Finding an alternating path allowed us to extend the matching. This is essentially Boom's algorithm and it is nice because it is direct and combinatorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we show that the problem can be cast easily as a max flow problem. In the max flow problem, we are given a directed graph with two special vertices, $source$ and $sink$. The edges have non-negative numbers called capacities. We want to assign numbers (a flow) to the edges such that each edge's flow is not more than its capacity, and, for each vertex, the sum of the flows into that vertex are equal to the flows out of that vertex. Finally, the solution to the max flow problem is the maximum amount of flow into the sink.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a contruction that transforms our bipartite matching problem into a max flow problem: Orient the edges of $G$ from $W$ to $J$ and add two additional vertices $source$ and $sink$. Draw an edge from $source$ to each vertex of $W$ and an edge from each vertex of $J$ to $sink$. Assign the capacity of $1$ to each edge. It should be clear that each matching corresponds to a flow. Since flows do not need to be integers, it's less obvious that each flow can be transformed into a matching.\n",

For example, the linear program associated with the max flow problem sets $n=V(G)+E(G)$ and $m=E(G)+2V(G)$. We create $n$ variables, one for each edge of the flow graph. We get a constraint for each edge (that the flow cannot exceed the capacity) and two constraints for each vertex (the flow into a vertex is equal to the flow out; equality is two non-strict inequalities)."

The equation $A^Ty \\geq c$ reflects that we should sell each ingredient for at least as much money as we could have made from making drinks with those ingredients.

    "Linear programming is a special case of a more general technique, convex programming, where the feasible region is assumed to be convex. The Elipsoid method is a theoretically-polynomial time method that solves convex programming by repeatedly using smaller and smaller elipsoids to hone in on the optimal solution. This method is not practical, but it is of theoretical interest because it demonstrates that linear programming actually has a polynomial work solution.\n",

    "A better technique for solving convex programming problems in polynomial time are known as <i>interior point methods</i>. These methods use the fact that the feasible region is convex to search a path through the interior of the feasible region for an optimal point. Detailed information on these methods can be found [here](https://github.com/ShiqinHuo/Numerical-Optimization-Books/blob/master/Convex%20Optimization%20Boyd.pdf)."
