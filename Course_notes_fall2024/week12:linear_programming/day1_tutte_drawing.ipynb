    "Let $G$ be a graph. By definition, $G$ is just a set of vertices with an adjacency relation. The vertices do not have spatial locations. By \"drawing a graph\" we mean assigning spatial locations in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ to $V(G)$ and curves to each edge of $G$ that begin and end at the respective vertices. A graph drawing is planar if its edges do not cross, and a graph is planar if it has a planar drawing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Tutte algorithm for drawing planar graphs without crossings can be written in terms of matrices. See [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEzPPMhR8XE) for a brief video explanation. See also Graphs and Geometry by Laszlo Lovasz.\n",

    "The idea is to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Identify a minimal cycle to serve as the outer face.\n",
    "    - Use a graph search algorithm.\n",
    "2. Fix the positions of the vertices on the outer face.\n",
    "3. Design a system of linear equations that models the edges as rubber bands with spring constants $c_{u,v}$. (We can assume this mass is $c_{u,v}=1$ for each edge.)\n",

    "\n",
    "The amount of potential energy stored in the rubber band representing an edge $v\\sim u$ is $c_{v,u}|p_v - p_u|^2$, so the total potential energy is $\\sum_{u,v\\in E(G)} c_{v,u}|p_v - p_u|^2$. This is a convex equation and so has a unique minimum. The minimum is achieved when each vertex is in balance, so that the forces of its neighbors cancel out. Therefore, we introduce the constraints that for each vertex $v\\in V(G)$, $\\sum_{u\\in \\mathcal{N}(v)} c_{u,v} (p_u-p_v)=0$. This is really two constraints- one for each coordinate.\n",

The two rows corresponding to the constraints on an unpinned vertex $v$ are given by $A_{v,u,z}=\\begin{cases}-\\sum_{u\\in \\mathcal{N}(v)} c_{u,v} &\\text{if }v=u\\\\ c_{u,v} &\\text{if } u\\in \\mathcal{N}(v)\\\\ 0 &\\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}$.\n",

If no vertices are pinned ($k=0$), then each row of $A$ sums to $0$, which demonstrates that the constraints are not all independent, and the solution is not unique. \n",

    "In order to represent a graph visually, we must understand the graph well enough so that it can be displayed clearly. In this sense, every algorithm for drawing graphs can be turned into an algorithm to calculate properties of the graphs. In particular, the Tutte drawing algorithm can be modified into an algorithm to calculate vertex connectivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that the vertex connectivity of a graph is the minimum number of vetices that can be removed to disconnect the graph. When the graph is $3$-connected, Tutte's theorem says that it can be drawn in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ in general position. Laszlo Lovasz proved a stronger statement: If the graph is $k$ connected, and we choose the edge coefficients $c_{u,v}$ and pinned vertices at random, then with high probability the Tutte drawing in $\\mathbb{R}^{k-1}$ can be drawn in general position. But if the graph is not $k$ connected, then with high probability, the resulting graph will not be in general position.\n",
