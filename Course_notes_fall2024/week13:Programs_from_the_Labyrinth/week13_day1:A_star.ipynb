    "We continue to develop our maze program by investigating how some search methods can be used to solve the maze. The most important algorithm that we will see is the [A-star algorithm](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/courses/soco/projects/2003-04/intelligent-search/astar.html#:~:text=A*'s%20optimality%20is,an%20optimal%20path%20to%20g.), which is a minor modification of Dijkstra's algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our Labyrinth program, suppose that we have already implemented generating the maze by creating a planar graph and selecting a set of edges to be 'opened.' For the final, the students will implement depth-first search and the A-star algorithm. We have already seen depth-first search in detail, so let us turn to the A-star algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Dijkstra's Algorithm Recap</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "Dijkstra's algorithm can be viewed as both a greedy and dynamic program, where we build up a tree of the shortest distances from a given start vertex by greedily selecting the vertex on the frontier that minimizes the distance to this start vertex $s$. At any step in the program when the explored tree is $t$, let $g_t(n)$ be the shortest distance from the start node $s$ to the node $n$. \n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>A-Star algorithm.</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "The A-star algorithm is very similar. If we know the location of the final node $r$, then we can estimate the shortest path from a node $n$ to $r$ using the Euclidean distance, which we denote $h(n)$. Instead of greedily choosing the node that minimizes $g_t(n)$, we greedily choose the node that minimizes $f_t(n) = g_t(n)+h(n)$. This defines the A-star algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "More generally, we can use any function $h(n)$ in place of the Euclidean distance. For example, in solving the 2x2x2 Pocket cube, we set $h(n)$ to be the minimum of the number of moves needed to correctly position all of the cubies and the number of moves needed to correctly orient all of the cubies.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will show that the A star algorithm finds the shortest path from $s$ to $r$ as long as $h(n)$ is always an underestimate of the length of the shortest path. When the graph is embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ and $h(n)$ is the Euclidean distance, and the edges are measured according to their Euclidean distances, it is true that $h(n)$ is always an underestimate, because it measures the length of the most direct route. When the graph has the states of the pocket cube as its vertices and pocket cube moves as its edges and $h(n)$ is the heuristic function for the pocket cube, $h(n)$ is still an underestimate because, in order to solve the cube, we at least need to put all of the cubies in the right places and correctly orient them."
