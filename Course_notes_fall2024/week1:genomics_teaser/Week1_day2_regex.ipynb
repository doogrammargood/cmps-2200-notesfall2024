    "\n",
    "Intuitively, the reason that $\\mathcal{S}$ is not regular is that we need memory to recognize members of $\\mathcal{S}$. The naive way to do this is to step through the string one chacater at a time and maintain a counter for the number of $a's$ encountered. Then, once we're done with the $a$'s, we count the number of $t$'s and check that the two are equal. However, finite state machines only have finite memory (in the form of finite states) and so cannot maintain a variable to count the (unbounded) number of $a$'s.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, this is not a proof, since one might argue that there is a better way to recognize these strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate that this is the case, we use an argument called the <i>Pumping Lemma</i>. Suppose that a state machine $\\mathcal{M}$ could recognize $\\mathcal{S}$. Since $\\mathcal{M}$ has only finitely many states, we can apply the pigeon hole principle to conclude that $\\mathcal{M}$ finds itself in the same state twice when reading words that are long enough. To be more specific, let $M$ be the number of states of $\\mathcal{M}$. The word $W=``a\"*(M+1) +``t\"*(M+1) \\in \\mathcal{S}$. The first half of the word is longer than $M$, so $\\mathcal{M}$ will encounter the same state twice when reading $W$. Suppose this state is encountered at steps $m_1$ and $m_2$. Then $\\mathcal{M}$ completes a cycle in the directed graph its states when reading the word $W$ between steps $m_1$ and $m_2$, for $m_2>m_1$. We can remove this loop without changing the behavior of the machine on subsequent states. This shows that $W^\\prime \\coloneqq ``a\"*(M+1-(m_2-m_1)) +``t\"*(M+1)$ is accepted by $\\mathcal{M}$. But clearly $W^\\prime \\not \\in \\mathcal{S}$, so we have a contradiction.\n",
