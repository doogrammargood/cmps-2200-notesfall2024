    "We first formalize the problem so that we have a clear understanding of what is allowed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume that the input is given as items on a RAM machine in the cells indexed by $0,1,...,n-1$. Often, these items are integers, but they could be more complicated, like students' names. Items can have the same value but be different. For example, two students may have the same name.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In any step, we are allowed to read the item at an index, overwrite the item at an index or compare two items to see which one is greater.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using an additional memory cell, we can swap items using $3$ steps. Since $3\\in O(1)$, we can consider swapping to be a single operation without affecting the asymptotic runtime analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of the algorithm, we should have a sorted list of the items in the cells $0,\\dots,n-1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Suppose that we want to sort the list $1,2,3,4,5,\\dots,n-2, n-1,0$. We can almost do this in a single step: move the item $0$ to the index $-1$. This is an $O(1)$ algorithm. Except this is not the desired output, because $0$ is at index $-1$, not at index $0$. To correctly solve the problem, each item will need to be moved. For example $1$ is currently at index $0$, so it will need to be moved. This means that we require at least $n$ operations to sort this list, and would have an algorithm with $\\Omega(n)$ work."

    "\n",
    "1. Bubble Sort:\n",
    "    - This sorting method compares and swaps the first two items, then the second two items, etc. Lastly, it compares the item at index $n-2$ the item at $n-1$, swapping them if they are out of order. After this, the largest item is on bottom. It sinks like a stone, while the other items \"bubble\" up to the top. Then, we repeat again on the other $n-1$ items.\n",
    "    - Bubble sort is the most important sorting method to know, because everyone knows it, and it provides a common example.\n",
    "2. Selection Sort:\n",
    "    - This sorting method steps through the list to \"select\" the smallest element. Then it puts the smallest element first. Then it repeats on the other $n-1$ elements that are not first.\n",
    "    - Selection sort is almost the reverse of Bubble sort. Bubble sort puts the largest item last, then repeats. Selection sort puts the smallest item first then repeats.\n",
    "3. Insertion Sort:\n",
    "    - Insertion sort is the method that contract bridge players use to organize their hands. It consists of a loop from $0$ to $n-1$. At stage $k$ of the loop, the first $k$ items are sorted. The algorithm investigates the item at index $k+1$ and determines where to put it so that the first $k+1$ items are sorted."
