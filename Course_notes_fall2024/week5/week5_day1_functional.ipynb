The allowable symbols are variables (to stand in for functions), $x,y,z,\\dots$, parenthesis and square brackets, and a special symbol $\\lambda$ that announces that a function is being defined.\n",

    "The $\\lambda$-terms are defined inductively:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Every variable is a $\\lambda$-term. (Base case)\n",
    "2. If $M$ and $N$ are $\\lambda$-terms, so is $(MN)$. (Representing function application.)\n",
    "3. If $M$ is a $\\lambda$-term and $x$ is a free variable of $M$, then $\\lambda x[M]$ is a $\\lambda$-term. (Representing the function that on input $x$ returns the $\\lambda$-term $M$).\n",
    "\n",
    "Every $\\lambda$-term is composed of variables that can be one of two types. Roughly speaking, The <i>bound variables</i> are the variables imediately to the right of $\\lambda$. The <i>free variables</i> are the variables that are not bound. For example, in $\\lambda x[xy]$, the variable $x$ is bound and $y$ is free.\n",

Alternatively, we can define the natural numbers using the $\\lambda$-calculus to illustrate how it can provide a foundation to mathematics. [source](https://sskelkar.github.io/representing-natural-numbers-in-lambda-calculus/). The number $2$ is represented by $\\lambda f[\\lambda z[f(f(z))]]$.

This is one way to understand the fact the problem of whether two $\\lambda$-expressions are equal is undecidable.

We often add <i>types</i> to the $\\lambda$-calculus that specify the allowed inputs and outputs for each lambda term. The added restriction provides more support for programming: The compiler checks that the input/output types are correct for each function application. If so, then the composition of the functions is well-defined, and will run without error.\n",

    "The <i>Curry-Howard-Lambek Correspondence</i> relates the typed $\\lambda$-calculus to proofs via the mathematics of <i>category theory</i>. We can encode logic into the types, so that checking that the composition of functions in a functional program is tantamount to checking that the steps of the corresponding proof are correct. In this view, the program is a proof of its own validity. Compiling the program amounts to checking the proof: If it compiles, there will be no runtime errors. It is possible to encode logic into the types to verify properties of the program during the compiling phase so that you can have guarantees about the resulting program.\n",
